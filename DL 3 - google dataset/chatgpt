Thanks for sharing the notebook. Let's walk through the first few code cells **line by line**, explaining **what each does**, **why it's used**, and **how it connects to RNN and time series analysis**, assuming you're new to this.

---

### 📦 **Code Cell 1**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `pandas as pd`: Used for handling structured data like tables (think of Excel). It’s the main tool for loading and manipulating time series data.
* `numpy as np`: Used for numerical operations like arrays and math functions. RNN input/output needs data in array form.
* `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Used for plotting graphs—important for **visualizing trends** in stock prices.
* `seaborn as sns`: A nicer plotting library built on matplotlib, used for **statistical data visualization**.

#### 📌 Why?

You’ll use these libraries for:

* Reading and preparing stock price data
* Creating the dataset that an RNN can process
* Plotting real vs predicted stock values for evaluation

---

### 📄 **Code Cell 2**

```python
df = pd.read_csv('goog.csv')
df.head()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `pd.read_csv('goog.csv')`: Reads the Google stock data from a CSV file into a **DataFrame** (a table).
* `df.head()`: Shows the first 5 rows of the data. Useful to check what kind of columns and values you're working with.

#### 📌 Why?

To work with time series data like stock prices, we first need to load it into memory. This step is the starting point for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

---

### 📅 **Code Cell 3**

```python
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='mixed')
df.head()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `pd.to_datetime(...)`: Converts the `'Date'` column (which is text) into an actual **datetime** object that Python can understand.
* `format='mixed'`: Tells pandas to guess the format if not consistent.

#### 📌 Why?

Time series analysis is **based on time**, so dates must be in proper format to **sort**, **filter**, or **plot** over time.

---

### 🔃 **Code Cell 4**

```python
df.sort_values('Date', inplace=True)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `sort_values('Date')`: Sorts the dataset by date in **chronological order**.
* `inplace=True`: Makes the change directly in the original dataset.

#### 📌 Why?

RNNs depend on **sequential input**—the order of the data is critical. Sorting ensures the model "learns" the pattern over time in the correct order.

---

### 🧱 **Code Cell 5**

```python
columns = df.columns[1:]
columns
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df.columns[1:]`: Gets all column names except the first one (likely 'Date').
* Stores them in the `columns` variable.

#### 📌 Why?

This is likely done to identify which columns (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close prices) will be used for training and prediction.

---

Would you like me to continue explaining the rest of the code cells step-by-step as well?

Let’s continue breaking down the next set of code cells **line by line**, explaining what they do, how they relate to theory, and why they’re important.

---

### 💾 **Code Cell 6**

```python
data = df[columns].values
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Takes all columns (except 'Date') and converts them into a NumPy array.
* `data` now contains stock features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, etc.

#### 📌 Why?

Neural networks (including RNNs) don’t work on DataFrames. They need raw numerical arrays—this is a **data preprocessing** step.

---

### 📊 **Code Cell 7**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* **`MinMaxScaler()`**: Normalizes all values to a range between 0 and 1.
* `fit_transform(data)`: Fits the scaler and applies it to `data`.

#### 📌 Why?

RNNs and LSTMs are sensitive to input scale. **Scaling** improves training speed and accuracy by avoiding large weight updates (which can lead to unstable training).

---

### 🔁 **Code Cell 8**

```python
def generate_sequential_data(data, seq_length):
    l = len(data)
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(l-seq_length):
        x.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
        y.append(data[i+seq_length][3])
    return np.array(x), np.array(y)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* This function slices the data into **sliding windows** of sequences.
* Each `x[i]` is a sequence of 10 time steps.
* `y[i]` is the stock’s **Close price** (`[3]`) at the next time step.

#### 📌 Why?

This is a **key step in time series prediction**. RNNs learn by seeing how past values relate to future ones. We're training the model to predict the next "Close" price from the last 10 days.

---

### 📐 **Code Cell 9**

```python
seq_length = 10
x, y = generate_sequential_data(data, seq_length)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Sets how many past days the model should look at (`seq_length = 10`).
* Generates the training input (`x`) and output (`y`) using the function above.

#### 📌 Why?

This prepares the input shape expected by an RNN: sequences of 10 time steps.

---

### 🔀 **Code Cell 10**

```python
train_size = 0.8
data_len = len(x)
split_length = int(data_len * train_size)

x_train = x[:split_length]
y_train = y[:split_length]

x_test = x[split_length:]
y_test = y[split_length:]
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Splits data into **80% training** and **20% testing**.
* This is important to check if the model is learning well (train) and generalizing (test).

#### 📌 Why?

Helps prevent **overfitting**. You want the model to perform well on data it hasn’t seen before.

---

### 🧠 **Code Cell 11**

```python
features = len(columns)
input_shape = (seq_length, features)

from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Input

model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=input_shape),
    LSTM(units=64),
    Dense(units=256, activation='relu'),
    Dense(units=1, activation='relu')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mean_squared_error'])
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Defines a **Sequential RNN model** using Keras.

* Layers:

  * `Input`: Shape = (10 time steps, number of features)
  * `LSTM`: Learns temporal patterns from the sequences.
  * `Dense`: Fully connected layer (with ReLU activation).
  * Final `Dense(1)`: Predicts a single number (the next day's **Close** price).

* `compile()`: Prepares model for training:

  * **Loss**: Mean Squared Error (good for regression)
  * **Optimizer**: Adam (efficient and commonly used)

#### 📌 Why?

This structure captures **temporal dependencies** in stock prices. LSTM improves over simple RNN by remembering long-term dependencies, addressing **vanishing gradient** problems.

---

### 📋 **Code Cell 12**

```python
model.summary()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Shows the model’s architecture, number of parameters, and shapes.

#### 📌 Why?

Always review the model before training to verify it’s built correctly.

---

### 🏋️ **Code Cell 13**

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* **Trains** the model for 50 full passes (epochs) over the training data.
* `batch_size=64`: Processes 64 sequences at a time.
* `validation_data`: Allows the model to evaluate performance on test data after each epoch.

#### 📌 Why?

The core of the learning happens here. The model learns to minimize the prediction error by adjusting its weights.

---

### 🧪 **Code Cell 14**

```python
loss, metric = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"MSE: {metric}")
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Tests the trained model on the test set.
* Prints the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

#### 📌 Why?

This is your **model evaluation step**. MSE tells you how far off your predictions are from the actual prices.

---

### 📈 **Code Cell 15**

```python
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)

plt.plot(y_pred, label='Predicted')
plt.plot(y_test, label='Actual')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Generates predictions on the test data.
* Plots both actual and predicted stock prices to **visually compare** them.

#### 📌 Why?

Helps you see if the RNN model is **learning the trend**—an essential part of validating time series models.
