Great, Shreya! Let's break this entire C++ code down **line-by-line**, from the absolute basics, assuming you're just getting started with both **C++** and **OpenMP** for **parallel computing**. We'll cover the meaning of each line, the purpose of each function, and why things are done the way they are.

## ðŸ§  **Big Picture First: What Does This Program Do?**

This program compares **sequential and parallel implementations** of **Bubble Sort** and **Merge Sort** using **OpenMP**, a tool used for multi-threaded programming in C/C++.

It:

1. Sorts a large array using 4 different approaches.
2. Measures the execution time of each method.
3. Calculates the **speedup** (how much faster parallel is than sequential).

## âœ… **Step-by-Step Line-by-Line Explanation**

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Headers and Setup**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <omp.h>
```

* `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`

  * A **GCC extension** that includes all standard C++ libraries.
  * This includes things like `iostream`, `vector`, `algorithm`, `cstdlib`, etc.
  * Not standard in industry â€” but okay in learning environments.

* `#include <omp.h>`

  * Includes the **OpenMP** library.
  * Allows use of parallel constructs like `#pragma omp parallel`, `omp_get_wtime()`, etc.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Using Namespace**

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

* Makes it so you donâ€™t need to write `std::vector` or `std::cout` every time.
* **Not preferred in large projects**, but good for simplicity in small ones.

---

## âœ… **Bubble Sort - Sequential Version**

```cpp
void bubbleSort(vector<int> &arr)
{
    int n = arr.size();
```

* `vector<int> &arr`: Passes array **by reference** (no copy, edits original).
* `arr.size()` gives the number of elements.

```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j)
        {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
            {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* Classic **Bubble Sort**:

  * Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements if theyâ€™re out of order.
  * After each full pass, the largest element "bubbles" to the end.
  * Complexity: **O(nÂ²)** (very slow for large inputs).

---

## âœ… **Merge Sort - Sequential Version**

```cpp
void merge(vector<int> &arr, int l, int m, int r)
```

* Merges two sorted halves of an array:

  * Left half: `arr[l...m]`
  * Right half: `arr[m+1...r]`

```cpp
    int n1 = m - l + 1;
    int n2 = r - m;

    vector<int> L(n1), R(n2);

    for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
        L[i] = arr[l + i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n2; ++j)
        R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j];
```

* Creates two new arrays `L` and `R` for left and right halves.

```cpp
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = l;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2)
    {
        if (L[i] <= R[j])
            arr[k++] = L[i++];
        else
            arr[k++] = R[j++];
    }

    while (i < n1)
        arr[k++] = L[i++];
    while (j < n2)
        arr[k++] = R[j++];
}
```

* Combines two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

```cpp
void mergeSort(vector<int> &arr, int l, int r)
```

* Recursive function:

  * Divides array into halves, sorts them individually.
  * Uses `merge()` to combine.
  * Complexity: **O(n log n)**.

---

## âœ… **Parallel Bubble Sort**

```cpp
void parallelBubbleSort(vector<int> &arr)
{
    int n = arr.size();
```

```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        int start = i % 2;
        #pragma omp parallel for default(none) shared(arr, n, start)
        for (int j = start; j < n - 1; j += 2)
        {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
        }
    }
}
```

* `start = i % 2`:

  * Alternates between comparing even pairs and odd pairs.
  * This is called the **odd-even transposition sort**.
* `#pragma omp parallel for`: Runs the for-loop in parallel.

  * Threads each handle part of the array.

> âœ… Still **O(nÂ²)** but may perform faster due to parallelism.

## âœ… **Parallel Merge Sort**

```cpp
void parallelMergeSort(vector<int> &arr, int l, int r)
```

```cpp
    if (l < r)
    {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        
        #pragma omp parallel sections
        {
            #pragma omp section
            parallelMergeSort(arr, l, m);
            #pragma omp section
            parallelMergeSort(arr, m + 1, r);
        }
        merge(arr, l, m, r);
    }
}
```

* Uses **OpenMP parallel sections** to divide the merge sort into parallel tasks.
* Two recursive calls to `parallelMergeSort` can run on separate threads.
* Ideal parallel algorithm because of its **divide-and-conquer** structure.

---

## âœ… **Main Function â€“ Measuring Performance**

```cpp
int main()
{
    omp_set_num_threads(4); 
```

* Tells OpenMP to use **4 threads** for parallel execution.

```cpp
    const int size = 10000;
    vector<int> arr(size), arr_copy(size);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
    {
        arr[i] = rand() % 1000;
        arr_copy[i] = arr[i];
    }
```

* Generates a random array of 10,000 numbers from 0 to 999.
* `arr_copy` keeps the original array for resetting.

---

## ðŸ•’ **Timing and Testing Each Version**

```cpp
    double start = omp_get_wtime();
    bubbleSort(arr);
    double stop = omp_get_wtime();
    double seq_duration_bubble = stop - start;
```

* Measures execution time for **sequential Bubble Sort** using `omp_get_wtime()`.

Same is repeated for:

* Parallel Bubble Sort
* Sequential Merge Sort
* Parallel Merge Sort

For parallel merge sort, there's a special use of `#pragma omp single`:

```cpp
#pragma omp parallel
{
    #pragma omp single
    {
        parallelMergeSort(arr, 0, size - 1);
    }
}
```

* Ensures only one thread **starts** the merge sort (which will fork other threads internally).

---

## ðŸ“Š **Displaying Results**

```cpp
    cout << "Sequential Bubble Sort Time: " << seq_duration_bubble * 1e6 << " microseconds" << endl;
```

* Shows time taken in **microseconds (Âµs)**.
* Calculates **Speedup = Sequential time / Parallel time**

Also prints:

* Total number of threads
* Time for each version
* Speedup for both sorting types
* Notes about time complexity

---

## âœ… **Complexity Reminder**

At the end:

```cpp
cout << "The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2)..." << endl;
```

Helps remind you:

* Bubble Sort is inefficient.
* Merge Sort is better for larger datasets.
* Parallelizing helps, but not always by a lot (depends on input, thread count, system).
