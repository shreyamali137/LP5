Great, Shreya! Let's break your CUDA C++ matrix multiplication code **line by line**, with explanations for **each concept** as if you're completely new to this. I'll keep things very beginner-friendly and detailed.

---

### ðŸ”¹ HEADER FILES

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;
```

* `#include <iostream>`: Includes the input-output stream library. It allows you to use `cin` and `cout`.
* `#include <cuda_runtime.h>`: This is needed for CUDA programming. It contains functions like `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMemcpy`, and `cudaFree`, which help interact with the GPU.
* `using namespace std;`: So that you don't need to write `std::cout`, `std::cin`, etc., every time.
* `using namespace std::chrono;`: To use C++'s time functions (for measuring how long things take).

---

### ðŸ”¹ GPU KERNEL FUNCTION

```cpp
__global__ void multiply(int* A, int* B, int* C, int M, int N, int K)
```

* `__global__`: This tells CUDA that this function runs **on the GPU** and is called **from the CPU**.
* `multiply(...)`: Function to multiply matrices A and B and store result in C.

Now inside the kernel:

```cpp
int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
```

These calculate which row and column this thread is working on.

* `blockIdx`: Index of the block in the grid.
* `blockDim`: Size (number of threads) of each block.
* `threadIdx`: Index of the thread within its block.
* `row`, `col`: Position in the output matrix `C` this thread is responsible for.

```cpp
if (row < M && col < K)
```

Makes sure we donâ€™t go out of matrix bounds.

```cpp
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    sum += A[row * N + i] * B[i * K + col];
}
C[row * K + col] = sum;
```

This loop does the actual matrix multiplication:

* Multiply the row of `A` with column of `B` and store the result in `C[row][col]`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ INITIALIZE FUNCTION

```cpp
void initialize(int* matrix, int rows, int cols)
```

* Function to take matrix input from user using `cin`.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rows * cols; i++) {
    cout << "Enter element " << i + 1 << ": ";
    cin >> matrix[i];
}
```

* User enters the matrix elements one by one.

---

### ðŸ”¹ PRINT FUNCTION

```cpp
void print(int* matrix, int rows, int cols)
```

* Nicely prints the matrix in a 2D format.

```cpp
for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
    for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
        cout << matrix[row * cols + col] << " ";
    }
    cout << '\n';
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ SEQUENTIAL MULTIPLICATION (CPU)

```cpp
void sequentialMultiply(int* A, int* B, int* C, int M, int N, int K)
```

Performs matrix multiplication **on CPU**, exactly how it's taught in school.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < K; j++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            sum += A[i * N + k] * B[k * K + j];
        }
        C[i * K + j] = sum;
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ MAIN FUNCTION

```cpp
int main()
```

Starts the program. Now step by step:

```cpp
int M, N, K;
cout << "Enter the number of rows and columns of the first matrix: ";
cin >> M >> N;
cout << "Enter the number of columns of the second matrix: ";
cin >> K;
```

Takes matrix dimensions:

* Matrix A is M Ã— N
* Matrix B is N Ã— K
* Result C is M Ã— K

---

### ðŸ”¹ MEMORY ALLOCATION ON CPU

```cpp
int* A, * B, * C;
A = new int[M * N];
B = new int[N * K];
C = new int[M * K];
```

* `A`, `B`, and `C` are pointers to matrices stored in heap memory.

---

### ðŸ”¹ INPUT MATRICES

```cpp
initialize(A, M, N);
initialize(B, N, K);
```

Takes input for both matrices.

---

### ðŸ”¹ DISPLAY MATRICES

```cpp
print(A, M, N);
print(B, N, K);
```

Print matrices for visual verification.

---

### ðŸ”¹ ALLOCATE MEMORY ON GPU

```cpp
int* X, * Y, * Z;
cudaMalloc(&X, M * N * sizeof(int));
cudaMalloc(&Y, N * K * sizeof(int));
cudaMalloc(&Z, M * K * sizeof(int));
```

* `cudaMalloc`: Allocates memory on **GPU device**.
* X, Y, Z are GPU equivalents of A, B, C.

---

### ðŸ”¹ COPY DATA TO GPU

```cpp
cudaMemcpy(X, A, M * N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
cudaMemcpy(Y, B, N * K * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
```

* `cudaMemcpy`: Copies data from CPU (Host) to GPU (Device).

---

### ðŸ”¹ SET UP CUDA BLOCKS & THREADS

```cpp
int THREADS = 16;
int BLOCKS = (M + THREADS - 1) / THREADS;

dim3 threads(THREADS, THREADS);
dim3 blocks(BLOCKS, BLOCKS);
```

* `dim3`: Used to define thread/block structure in 2D.
* This sets up a 2D grid of blocks, each block having 16Ã—16 threads (common CUDA setting).

---

### ðŸ”¹ SEQUENTIAL MULTIPLICATION TIMING

```cpp
auto start = high_resolution_clock::now();
sequentialMultiply(A, B, C, M, N, K);
auto stop = high_resolution_clock::now();
auto seq_duration = duration_cast<microseconds>(stop - start);
```

* Measures time taken to do CPU matrix multiplication.

---

### ðŸ”¹ PRINT SEQUENTIAL RESULT

```cpp
print(C, M, K);
```

* Shows result of CPU multiplication.

---

### ðŸ”¹ PARALLEL MULTIPLICATION ON GPU

```cpp
start = high_resolution_clock::now();
multiply<<<blocks, threads>>>(X, Y, Z, M, N, K);
cudaMemcpy(C, Z, M * K * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
stop = high_resolution_clock::now();
auto par_duration = duration_cast<microseconds>(stop - start);
```

* Launches the GPU kernel using `<<<blocks, threads>>>`.
* Copies back result from GPU to CPU after computation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ PRINT GPU RESULT

```cpp
print(C, M, K);
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ PRINT TIME TAKEN

```cpp
cout << "Sequential Multiplication Time: " << seq_duration.count() << " microseconds" << endl;
cout << "Parallel Multiplication Time: " << par_duration.count() << " microseconds" << endl;
```

Compare how long it took for CPU vs GPU.

---

### ðŸ”¹ CLEAN UP MEMORY

```cpp
delete[] A;
delete[] B;
delete[] C;
cudaFree(X);
cudaFree(Y);
cudaFree(Z);
```

* `delete[]`: Frees CPU memory.
* `cudaFree`: Frees GPU memory.
