Great! I've loaded the notebook. Let's start with a **line-by-line explanation** of each code cell. I’ll go step-by-step and break it down for someone with **no prior experience**.

---

### 📦 **Code Cell 1**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `import`: This keyword is used to **bring in external Python libraries** that are not built into the core language.
* `pandas as pd`:

  * `pandas` is a popular library for **data manipulation and analysis**.
  * We rename it as `pd` to make it easier to use later.
* `numpy as np`:

  * `numpy` is used for **numerical operations**, like arrays, math functions, and statistics.
  * We rename it as `np`.

✅ **Why needed?**
These are **foundational libraries** for handling datasets and mathematical operations in Machine Learning.

---

### 📂 **Code Cell 2**

```python
df = pd.read_csv('boston_housing.csv')
df.head()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df = ...`: We are storing our dataset into a variable called `df` (short for **dataframe**).
* `pd.read_csv(...)`: Reads a **CSV (Comma Separated Values)** file into a dataframe. `pandas` helps turn raw data into structured tabular form.
* `'boston_housing.csv'`: The name of the file. It should be present in the same folder.
* `df.head()`: Shows the **first 5 rows** of the data, which is helpful for a quick preview.

✅ **Why needed?**
To **load the dataset** and confirm that it was read correctly.

---

### 📏 **Code Cell 3**

```python
print(df.shape)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df.shape`: Returns a **tuple** representing `(rows, columns)` of the dataset.
* `print(...)`: Displays the output.

✅ **Why needed?**
To know **how big** the dataset is — important for splitting into training and test sets.

---

### 🧼 **Code Cell 4**

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df.isnull()`: Checks for **missing values (nulls)** in each column.
* `.sum()`: Sums up how many missing values are there **per column**.

✅ **Why needed?**
Models can fail if they receive missing data. So this step checks for data **completeness**.

---

### 📊 **Code Cell 5**

```python
df.describe()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df.describe()`: Gives a **summary of statistics** for all **numeric columns**: mean, min, max, standard deviation, etc.

✅ **Why needed?**
To understand the **range and distribution** of data — helps with identifying outliers or irregularities.

---

I’ll now continue with the **next set of cells** (like data visualization, splitting, modeling, etc.). Would you like me to proceed?
It looks like the uploaded notebook file has been removed due to a session reset. Could you please re-upload the `BostonHousing.ipynb` file so I can continue explaining the remaining code cells for feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation?
Let's go through the next five cells of your notebook line by line, assuming you're completely new to this. You're now in the **model building and training phase**.

---
Great! Let's continue the **line-by-line beginner-friendly explanation** of the next set of code cells in your notebook.

---

### 📋 **Code Cell 6**

```python
df.info()
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df.info()` displays:

  * Number of **columns**
  * Each column's **data type** (int, float, object/text)
  * How many **non-null values** are there

✅ **Why needed?**
To check for:

* Missing values (again, quickly)
* Data types (important for modeling — e.g., models can't use text)

---

### 📊 **Code Cell 7**

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.histplot(df['MEDV'], kde = True)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `seaborn as sns`: Seaborn is a library for **advanced data visualization**.
* `histplot(...)`: Creates a **histogram**, which shows the **distribution of values**.
* `df['MEDV']`: Refers to the **target column** — MEDV means **Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s**.
* `kde=True`: Adds a **smooth curve** (Kernel Density Estimate) to show the distribution shape.

✅ **Why needed?**
To **visualize how house prices are distributed** — is it normal? skewed? Has outliers?

---

### 📦 **Code Cell 8**

```python
sns.boxplot(df['MEDV'])
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `boxplot(...)`: Shows the **minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, and max**.
* Useful for spotting **outliers** (shown as dots outside the whiskers).

✅ **Why needed?**
To detect **extreme values** in house prices that could affect model accuracy.

---

### 📈 **Code Cell 9**

```python
corr = df.corr()
corr.loc['MEDV'].sort_values(ascending=False)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `df.corr()`: Calculates **correlation** between all pairs of numeric columns (range from -1 to 1).
* High positive value = strong direct relationship
* High negative value = strong inverse relationship
* `corr.loc['MEDV']`: Gets correlation values **of all features with MEDV**
* `.sort_values(...)`: Sorts them to show which features are **most strongly correlated** with house price.

✅ **Why needed?**
To identify **important features** that affect house prices (for modeling).

---

### 🌡️ **Code Cell 10**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10))
sns.heatmap(corr, square=True, annot=True)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: The **base plotting library** used by Seaborn.
* `plt.subplots(...)`: Creates a figure and axes object with a specific size (12x10 inches).
* `sns.heatmap(...)`:

  * Visualizes the **correlation matrix** using color
  * `square=True`: makes the heatmap look neat
  * `annot=True`: adds **numbers** to each square

✅ **Why needed?**
To quickly **see how every feature relates to each other** and to the target (MEDV). Very useful for **feature selection**.

Would you like me to continue with the next steps — like feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation?


### 🔹 **Cell 11**

```python
X = df.iloc[:, :-1]
y = df['MEDV']
```

**Explanation:**

* `df` is your DataFrame containing the Boston housing dataset.
* `X` (features): Selects **all columns except the last one** (`:-1`). These are the input features (like number of rooms, crime rate, etc.).
* `y` (target): Selects the `'MEDV'` column, which represents **Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s** — the value we're predicting.

---

### 🔹 **Cell 12**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=4)
```

**Explanation:**

* Splits the dataset into:

  * `X_train`, `y_train`: 70% data for training
  * `X_test`, `y_test`: 30% data for testing
* `test_size=0.3` means 30% for testing.
* `random_state=4` ensures you get the **same split every time** you run the code (for reproducibility).

---

### 🔹 **Cell 13**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
```

**Explanation:**

* Normalization is important before feeding data into a neural network.
* `StandardScaler` standardizes features by **removing the mean and scaling to unit variance**.
* `fit_transform` on training data: calculates mean & std dev, then scales.
* `transform` on test data: uses the same mean & std dev from training set (never fit on test data).

---

### 🔹 **Cell 14**

```python
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()

model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=13))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

**Explanation:**

* This builds a **Deep Neural Network** for regression.
* `Sequential`: means layers will be added one after another.
* `Dense`: fully connected layer. Every neuron connects to every neuron in the next layer.
* `activation='relu'`: applies ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity.
* `input_dim=13`: there are 13 features in your dataset.
* Last layer: `Dense(1)` — only 1 output value (predicted price).
* `compile`: sets up the model for training.

  * `optimizer='adam'`: a very popular optimization algorithm.
  * `loss='mean_squared_error'`: common for regression problems.

---

### 🔹 **Cell 15**

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)
```

**Explanation:**

* Trains the model using your training data.
* `epochs=100`: passes through the entire training dataset 100 times to improve the model.

---

Would you like to continue with the remaining cells for predictions and evaluation?
Let's continue with the remaining code cells that deal with making predictions and evaluating the model’s performance:

---

### 🔹 **Cell 16**

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

**Explanation:**

* This line **uses the trained model** to predict prices (`y_pred`) for the **unseen test data** (`X_test`).
* These predictions will later be compared to the actual prices (`y_test`) to evaluate performance.

---

### 🔹 **Cell 17**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(r2)
```

**Explanation:**

* `r2_score`: R² (R-squared) is a popular metric for regression.
* It tells **how much of the variance** in the dependent variable (house prices) can be **explained by the features**.
* R² ranges:

  * 1 → perfect prediction
  * 0 → model does no better than predicting the mean
  * Negative → worse than random guessing

---

### 🔹 **Cell 18**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse = (np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))
print(rmse)
```

**Explanation:**

* `mean_squared_error`: Calculates the average squared difference between actual and predicted prices.
* `np.sqrt(...)`: Takes the square root to get **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** — gives error in the **same units** as the output (i.e., \$1000s).
* Lower RMSE → better predictions.

---

✅ **Summary of the flow:**

1. Data loaded and analyzed.
2. Features and target selected.
3. Data split and standardized.
4. Deep neural network built using Keras.
5. Model trained for 100 epochs.
6. Predictions made on test data.
7. Evaluation done using **R² score** and **RMSE**.
