Thanks for sharing the file! I'll walk you through the code inside `ImdbReviews.ipynb` line by line, explaining **every term and concept** as if you're brand new to Python, machine learning, and Jupyter notebooks.

Let me first open and read the contents of the notebook to analyze it.


Great! Let's start going through the code **line by line**, as if you're learning everything from scratch. These are the first few cells in your Jupyter Notebook:

---

### üü© **Code Cell 1**

```python
import pandas as pd

import numpy as np
```

#### üîç Line 1: `import pandas as pd`

* **`import`**: A Python keyword that brings external libraries (packages/modules) into your program.
* **`pandas`**: A very popular Python library used to work with **tabular data** (like Excel or CSV files). It helps you easily manipulate and analyze data.
* **`as pd`**: This gives the library a **nickname** (`pd`) so you don't have to write `pandas` every time. It's just a shortcut.

> Think of `pandas` like a spreadsheet tool inside Python.

#### üîç Line 2: `import numpy as np`

* **`numpy`**: Another important Python library that deals with **numbers and mathematical operations**, especially arrays.
* **`as np`**: Again, gives it a shortcut name.

> `numpy` is often used for behind-the-scenes number crunching.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 2**

```python
df = pd.read_csv('IMDB Dataset.csv')

df.head()
```

#### üîç Line 1: `df = pd.read_csv('IMDB Dataset.csv')`

* **`pd.read_csv(...)`**: A function from `pandas` that reads a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and loads it as a table into Python.
* **`'IMDB Dataset.csv'`**: This is the file name. It's assumed to be in the same folder as the notebook.
* **`df = ...`**: This saves the loaded data into a variable named `df`. This is short for **DataFrame**, which is a 2D table with rows and columns.

> At this point, you've loaded a dataset of movie reviews from a file into memory.

#### üîç Line 2: `df.head()`

* **`df.head()`**: A method that shows the **first 5 rows** of the dataset. It's useful to quickly inspect what the data looks like.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 3**

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

#### üîç `df.isnull()`

* Checks **each cell** in the dataset to see if it's empty (or missing data). Returns `True` for missing, `False` otherwise.

#### üîç `.sum()`

* Sums up how many missing values are there in each column.

> This line is checking if your dataset has any missing data.

---

Would you like me to continue explaining the next group of code cells in the same way?
Perfect! Let‚Äôs go through the next 3 code cells line by line with full explanations. These lines introduce **data exploration** and the beginnings of **deep learning**.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 4**

```python
df.info()
```

#### üîç `df.info()`

* This method gives you a **summary of the dataset**:

  * Number of rows and columns
  * Column names and data types (text, number, etc.)
  * Whether any column has **missing values**
* It‚Äôs often used to **understand the structure** of a dataset quickly.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 5**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns
```

#### üîç `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`

These are **plotting libraries** that let you visualize data with graphs.

* **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Very flexible but lower-level (you write more code to customize things).

  * Nicknamed `plt`
* **`seaborn`**: Built on top of matplotlib. Easier and more beautiful plots.

> Both libraries are essential tools for **data visualization** in Python.

---

#### üü© Next lines (still in Cell 5):

```python
# Sentiment count plot
sns.countplot(data=df, x='sentiment')

plt.title("Distribution of Sentiments")

plt.show()
```

* **`sns.countplot(...)`**: Creates a **bar plot** that shows how many reviews are labeled as each sentiment (e.g., "positive" vs "negative").
* **`x='sentiment'`**: Tells it to group data based on the `sentiment` column in `df`.
* **`plt.title(...)`**: Adds a title to the chart.
* **`plt.show()`**: Displays the chart.

> This plot gives you a sense of how balanced your dataset is ‚Äî are there more positive reviews than negative?

---

#### üü© Next: Word count distribution

```python
df['review_length'] = df['review'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))
```

* **`df['review']`**: The column that contains full-text movie reviews.
* **`.apply(...)`**: Applies a function to each review.
* **`lambda x: len(x.split())`**:

  * `lambda` is an anonymous function.
  * `x.split()` breaks the review into words.
  * `len(...)` counts the words.
* This creates a new column called `review_length` with the **number of words in each review**.

> This is a form of **feature engineering** ‚Äî turning raw data into something useful.

---

```python
sns.histplot(df['review_length'], bins=50)

plt.title("Distribution of Review Length (in words)")

plt.xlabel("Word Count")

plt.ylabel("Frequency")

plt.show()
```

* **`sns.histplot(...)`**: Creates a histogram, which shows how many reviews fall into different word count ranges.
* **`bins=50`**: Number of bars (range groups) to divide the data into.

> This helps you see if reviews are mostly short or long.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 6**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
```

#### üîç `import tensorflow as tf`

* **TensorFlow** is a **deep learning framework** developed by Google.
* It‚Äôs used to build and train **neural networks**, especially for tasks like text classification or image recognition.
* **`tf`** is the standard shortcut name.

#### üîç `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`

* **`sklearn` (scikit-learn)**: A machine learning library.
* **`train_test_split`**: A function that splits your data into two sets:

  * **Training data**: Used to train the model.
  * **Test data**: Used to see how well the model performs on unseen data.

#### üîç `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer`

* **Tokenizer**: Converts text into sequences of numbers (each word gets a number).
* This is needed because models **can‚Äôt work directly with words** ‚Äî only with numbers.

#### üîç `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences`

* **pad\_sequences**: Makes sure all text sequences are the **same length** (by padding with zeros).
* Neural networks require inputs of the same shape.

---

Would you like to continue with the next few cells?
Let‚Äôs now go through the next three code cells. These steps are crucial for **preparing the text data** for use in a machine learning model.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 7**

```python
# Convert labels to binary

df['sentiment'] = df['sentiment'].map({'positive': 1, 'negative': 0})
```

#### üîç What this does:

* The `sentiment` column currently has **text labels**: `"positive"` and `"negative"`.
* **`.map({...})`** converts these text values to numbers:

  * `"positive"` ‚Üí `1`
  * `"negative"` ‚Üí `0`

> Machine learning models need **numbers**, not text. This is a common step in classification tasks.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 8**

```python
# Train-test split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['review'], df['sentiment'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

#### üîç What this does:

* **`df['review']`**: All the movie review texts (input data).
* **`df['sentiment']`**: Their corresponding labels (output).
* **`train_test_split(...)`**: Splits the dataset into two parts:

  * `X_train`, `y_train`: 80% of the data for training
  * `X_test`, `y_test`: 20% for testing (because of `test_size=0.2`)
* **`random_state=42`**: Sets a seed for reproducibility ‚Äî it ensures the split is the same each time you run the code.

> This is an essential step to **evaluate** your model‚Äôs performance on unseen data.

---

### üü© **Code Cell 9**

```python
# Tokenize and pad

vocab_size = 10000

max_length = 300

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size, oov_token="<OOV>")

tokenizer.fit_on_texts(X_train)
```

#### üîç Step by step:

##### ‚úÖ `vocab_size = 10000`

* You're telling the tokenizer to keep the **10,000 most common words** in the dataset.
* This limits memory usage and model size.

##### ‚úÖ `max_length = 300`

* Reviews will be **trimmed or padded** so that every one is exactly 300 words long.
* Neural networks require **fixed-length input**.

##### ‚úÖ `Tokenizer(...)`

* Creates a tokenizer object.
* **`num_words=10000`**: Keep only the most common 10,000 words.
* **`oov_token="<OOV>"`**:

  * ‚ÄúOOV‚Äù = Out Of Vocabulary.
  * If a word isn‚Äôt in the 10,000 most common, it gets replaced with `<OOV>`.

##### ‚úÖ `tokenizer.fit_on_texts(X_train)`

* This scans all training reviews and builds a **word-to-number dictionary**.

  * Example: `{"the": 1, "movie": 2, "was": 3, ...}`

> This prepares the text for conversion into sequences of numbers.

---

Would you like to continue with the next cells?
Here‚Äôs a line-by-line explanation of **code cell 10** from your notebook:

```python
actual_vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1  # Add 1 for padding/OOV token
```

* `tokenizer.word_index` is a dictionary mapping each word to a unique integer index, created during tokenization.
* `len(tokenizer.word_index)` gives the number of unique words found in the training corpus.
* `+ 1` accounts for the special padding or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) token, which is typically assigned index 0.
* This total becomes the actual vocabulary size needed for the embedding layer or other processing.

```python
print(f"Actual Vocabulary Size: {actual_vocab_size}")
```

* Prints the calculated vocabulary size to confirm or debug how many tokens will be considered by the model.

Would you like me to continue with code cell 11?
Here‚Äôs a line-by-line explanation of **code cell 11**:

```python
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

* `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`: This TensorFlow function returns a list of all physical GPU devices available on the machine.
* `len(...)`: Counts how many GPUs were found.
* `print(...)`: Outputs the number of available GPUs, which helps verify whether TensorFlow can leverage GPU acceleration for training.

Would you like to proceed to code cell 12?
Sure! Here's a **line-by-line explanation** of each code cell from **Cell 12 onward** in your notebook:

---

### üîπ **Cell 12**

```python
def predict_points(runs):
```

* This defines a function called `predict_points` that takes one argument: `runs`.

```python
    if runs < 50:
        return 2
```

* If the player scored fewer than 50 runs, return **2 points**.

```python
    elif 50 <= runs < 100:
        return 4
```

* If the player scored **between 50 and 99** runs, return **4 points**.

```python
    elif 100 <= runs < 150:
        return 6
```

* If the player scored **between 100 and 149** runs, return **6 points**.

```python
    else:
        return 8
```

* If the player scored **150 or more**, return **8 points**.

```python
def predict_category(points):
```

* This defines a second function called `predict_category` that accepts a `points` argument.

```python
    if points <= 2:
        return 'Poor'
```

* Points **2 or below** is categorized as `'Poor'`.

```python
    elif 3 <= points <= 4:
        return 'Average'
```

* Points in **\[3, 4]** is categorized as `'Average'`.

```python
    elif 5 <= points <= 6:
        return 'Good'
```

* Points in **\[5, 6]** is categorized as `'Good'`.

```python
    else:
        return 'Excellent'
```

* Points **above 6** is categorized as `'Excellent'`.

---

### üîπ **Cell 13**

```python
df['Predicted Points'] = df['Runs'].apply(predict_points)
```

* This creates a new column in the DataFrame `df` named `'Predicted Points'`, calculated by applying the `predict_points` function to each row in the `'Runs'` column.

```python
df['Predicted Category'] = df['Predicted Points'].apply(predict_category)
```

* Then it creates another new column `'Predicted Category'` by applying the `predict_category` function to each value in `'Predicted Points'`.

```python
df[['Runs', 'Predicted Points', 'Predicted Category']].head()
```

* Displays the **first 5 rows** of the columns `'Runs'`, `'Predicted Points'`, and `'Predicted Category'` for quick verification.

---

### üîπ **Cell 14**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
```

  * Splitting data into training/test sets,
  * Building a Random Forest model,
  * Evaluating model performance.

```python
df['Category'] = df['Category'].astype('category').cat.codes
```

* Converts the `'Category'` column (assumed to be text labels like 'Poor', 'Good', etc.) into **numerical codes** for modeling (e.g., `'Poor' ‚Üí 0`, `'Good' ‚Üí 1`...).

```python
features = ['Matches', 'Runs', 'Average', 'Strike Rate', '100s', '50s']
target = 'Category'
```

* Specifies the feature columns to use for prediction and the target column (`'Category'`).

```python
X = df[features]
y = df[target]
```

* `X` contains the input features, and `y` contains the labels (i.e., categories).

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

* Splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. `random_state=42` ensures reproducibility.

```python

```

* Initializes a Random Forest model with **100 decision trees** and a fixed seed for consistency.

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

* Trains the model using the training data.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

* Uses the trained model to predict the labels on the test set.

```python
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

* Prints the overall accuracy of predictions on the test set.

```python
