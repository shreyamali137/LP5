Absolutely, Shreya! Let‚Äôs break this code down **line by line** and explain it from the ground up like you're learning it for the first time. This program is about **graph traversal** using both **sequential (normal)** and **parallel (multi-threaded)** methods using **OpenMP**, which is a library in C++ used to run tasks in parallel to speed up performance.

---

### üìå **Header Files**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <omp.h>
```

* `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes **almost all standard C++ libraries** (e.g., iostream, vector, queue, etc.).
* `#include <omp.h>`: Includes the **OpenMP library**, which allows **parallel programming** using multiple threads.

---

### üìå **Graph Class Declaration**

```cpp
class Graph
{
    int V;                       // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adj;     // Adjacency list
```

* `int V`: Number of vertices (or nodes) in the graph.
* `vector<vector<int>> adj`: This is an **adjacency list** ‚Äî a list where each element contains a list of nodes it's connected to. A graph is made of **edges**, and this structure stores them.

---

### üìå **Constructor**

```cpp
Graph(int V)
{
    this->V = V;
    adj.resize(V);
}
```

* A **constructor** is a function that runs when an object is created.
* It initializes `V` with the number of vertices and **resizes** the `adj` list so it can hold V nodes.

---

### üìå **Add Edge Function**

```cpp
void addEdge(int u, int v)
{
    adj[u].push_back(v);
    adj[v].push_back(u);
}
```

* This function **adds an edge** between vertex `u` and vertex `v`.
* Since it‚Äôs an **undirected graph**, both directions are added (`u->v` and `v->u`).

---

## üîç Traversal Methods

### üìå Sequential BFS (Breadth-First Search)

```cpp
void sequentialBFS(int source)
{
    vector<bool> visited(adj.size(), false);
    queue<int> q;
    visited[source] = true;
    q.push(source);
```

* BFS visits all neighbors of a node before moving deeper.
* `visited[]`: Tracks which nodes have already been visited to avoid cycles.
* `queue`: Helps BFS explore neighbors **level by level**.

```cpp
    while (!q.empty())
    {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        cout << u << " ";
```

* While there are nodes in the queue, keep processing.
* Take the **front node** out and print it.

```cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < adj[u].size(); ++i)
        {
            int v = adj[u][i];
            if (!visited[v])
            {
                visited[v] = true;
                q.push(v);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* For each neighbor `v` of node `u`, if not visited:

  * Mark it as visited and add it to the queue.

---

### üìå Sequential DFS (Depth-First Search)

```cpp
void sequentialDFSUtil(int v, vector<bool> &visited)
{
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
```

* Mark node `v` as visited and print it.

```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < adj[v].size(); ++i)
    {
        int u = adj[v][i];
        if (!visited[u])
        {
            sequentialDFSUtil(u, visited);
        }
    }
}
```

* Go to each unvisited neighbor **recursively** ‚Äî this is the key idea of DFS.

```cpp
void sequentialDFS(int source)
{
    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    sequentialDFSUtil(source, visited);
}
```

* This is a wrapper that starts DFS from the `source` node.

---

## ‚ö° Parallel Versions

### üìå Parallel BFS

```cpp
void parallelBFS(int source)
{
    vector<bool> visited(adj.size(), false);
    queue<int> q;
    visited[source] = true;
    q.push(source);
```

Same start as sequential. The difference begins inside the loop.

```cpp
    while (!q.empty())
    {
        int u;
        #pragma omp parallel shared(q, visited)
        {
            #pragma omp single
            {
                u = q.front();
                q.pop();
                cout << u << " ";
            }
```

* Start a **parallel region**.
* `#pragma omp single`: Only one thread will extract the front node. This avoids race conditions (conflicts between threads).

```cpp
            if (!(adj[u].size() == 0))
            {
                #pragma omp for
                for (int i = 0; i <= adj[u].size() - 1; ++i)
                {
                    if (!visited[adj[u][i]])
                    {
                        #pragma omp critical
                        {
                            q.push(adj[u][i]);
                            visited[adj[u][i]] = true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* `#pragma omp for`: Divide the neighbors among threads.
* `#pragma omp critical`: Only one thread modifies the `queue` and `visited[]` at a time ‚Äî needed to avoid conflicts.

üü® **Why Parallel BFS?** It allows multiple neighbors to be processed **simultaneously**, potentially speeding things up for big graphs.

---

### üìå Parallel DFS

```cpp
void parallelDFSUtil(int v, vector<bool> &visited)
{
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
```

Same start as sequential. But now we use OpenMP:

```cpp
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < adj[v].size(); ++i)
    {
        int u = adj[v][i];
        if (!visited[u])
        {
            parallelDFSUtil(u, visited);
        }
    }
}
```

* `#pragma omp parallel for`: Tries to explore multiple neighbors **concurrently**.
* **Note**: DFS is not ideal for parallelism because of its **recursive and sequential nature**, but we still attempt it.

```cpp
void parallelDFS(int source)
{
    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    parallelDFSUtil(source, visited);
}
```

---

## üß™ Main Function

```cpp
int main()
{
    omp_set_num_threads(4);
```

* Sets OpenMP to use **4 threads**.

```cpp
    int num_vertices, num_edges, source;
    cout << "Enter the number of vertices in the graph: ";
    cin >> num_vertices;
    Graph g(num_vertices);
```

* Take number of vertices from the user and create a graph.

```cpp
    cout << "Enter the number of edges in the graph: ";
    cin >> num_edges;
```

* Input total edges to be added.

```cpp
    cout << "Enter the edges (u v): " << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_edges; ++i)
    {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        g.addEdge(u, v);
    }
```

* Input each edge and add it to the graph.

```cpp
    cout << "Enter the starting vertex for BFS and DFS: ";
    cin >> source;
```

* Input the starting vertex for traversal.

---

### ‚è± Timing Each Traversal

Each traversal (BFS/DFS, sequential/parallel) is timed:

```cpp
    double start = omp_get_wtime();
    ...
    double stop = omp_get_wtime();
    double duration = stop - start;
```

* Measures time taken in microseconds using OpenMP‚Äôs `omp_get_wtime()`.

---

## üîö Output

You‚Äôll see the output of:

* Sequential BFS and DFS with their time.
* Parallel BFS and DFS with their time.
* This helps compare which one is faster and how threading helps.

***differnece between parallel and sequesntial bfs dfs

Sure Shreya! Let‚Äôs break down the **difference between sequential and parallel BFS/DFS** in simple terms:

---

## üå≥ What Are BFS and DFS?

* **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**
  Explore the graph **level by level** starting from the source.
  Think of it like throwing a stone in water ‚Äî the ripples go outward level-by-level.

* **DFS (Depth-First Search):**
  Explore the graph by going **as deep as possible** before backtracking.
  Think of it like going down a maze path all the way before checking another.

---

## üö∂ Sequential vs üîÄ Parallel ‚Äî What's the Difference?

| Feature                  | Sequential BFS/DFS                  | Parallel BFS/DFS                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**            | Uses **1 thread only**              | Uses **multiple threads** (via OpenMP)                                    |
| **Speed**                | Slower for large graphs             | Can be faster because multiple parts of the graph are explored at once    |
| **Code Simplicity**      | Easier to write and debug           | More complex due to need for thread safety (e.g., `#pragma omp`)          |
| **Visited array**        | Only one thread changes it          | Multiple threads must **safely update** it (use `critical` or atomic ops) |
| **Queue/Stack handling** | No synchronization issues           | Needs **careful handling** to avoid race conditions                       |
| **Use Case**             | Good for small or less dense graphs | Good for **large, dense** graphs with many nodes                          |

## üéØ Example from Your Code

### BFS

* **Sequential BFS**:

  * Explores one level at a time using a queue.
  * One thread pops nodes and pushes their neighbors.

* **Parallel BFS**:

  * Still uses a queue but now **multiple threads** try to explore neighbors **in parallel**.
  * It uses OpenMP directives like `#pragma omp for` and `#pragma omp critical` to share work and avoid conflicts.

### DFS

* **Sequential DFS**:

  * A simple recursive function explores deep paths one at a time.

* **Parallel DFS**:

  * Each call to explore neighbors can be **given to a different thread** using `#pragma omp parallel for`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Not Always Use Parallel?

* For **small graphs**, parallelism may actually slow things down (thread overhead).
* Parallel code is **harder to debug** due to race conditions.
* Synchronization like `#pragma omp critical` can reduce the benefits if overused.

---

## üß† Summary

* **Sequential = simple, slower**
* **Parallel = faster (on big graphs), complex**
* Use **OpenMP** to run multiple parts of BFS/DFS **at the same time**.
